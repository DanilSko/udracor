Ukrainian Drama Corpus (UDraCor)

This repository contains texts of Ukrainian plays written in the XIX and early XX century. The plays are encoded in [TEI/XML](https://tei-c.org/). The TEI documents in this repository are being produced from a variety of sources, namely:

* ukrlib.com.ua
* l-ukrainka.name
* i-franko.name

and some others. The list of plays to be encoded is curated by Dr. Bohdan Tokarskyi and Daniil Skorinkin.
